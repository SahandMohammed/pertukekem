ðŸ“š Pertukekem: Online Bookstore App

## Introduction

Pertukekem is a Flutter-based mobile application that modernizes the book shopping experience by offering a unified platform for buying, selling, and accessing both new and second-hand books. The app supports a user-to-user marketplace, bookstore listings, secure checkout, delivery tracking, and an AI-powered assistant for book inquiries.

Built using Flutter and Firebase, Pertukekem integrates real-time data synchronization, secure authentication, and a modern MVVM architecture. Users can read e-books directly within the app through a built-in reader, which includes reading progress tracking.

The app aims to bridge the gap between readers and sellers with intuitive UI, flexible payment options, and community-driven features.
