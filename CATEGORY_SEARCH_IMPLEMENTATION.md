# Category Search Implementation

## Overview

Enhanced the search functionality in the Pertukekem bookstore app to enable users to search books by category, providing a more intuitive browsing experience.

## Features Added

### 1. Category Filter Interface

- Added a dedicated category filter section in the search tab
- Displays when the search input is empty (encourages category browsing)
- Shows popular book categories as clickable filter chips
- Categories include: Fiction, Non-Fiction, Science, Biography, History, Romance, Mystery, Fantasy, Self-Help, Business, Technology, Health, Children, Education, Art

### 2. Enhanced Search Functionality

- **Text Search**: Users can type category names directly in the search bar
- **Category Chips**: Users can click on category filter chips for quick browsing
- **Mixed Search**: Supports searching within categories or combining text with category filters
- **Smart Clearing**: Automatically clears category selection when typing in search box

### 3. Improved User Experience

- Updated search placeholder text to mention categories
- Enhanced empty state messages for category-specific searches
- Visual feedback for selected categories (highlighted filter chips)
- Smooth transitions between text search and category browsing

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Support (Already Existing)

The `CustomerHomeService.searchListings()` method already supported category search by:

- Fetching all listings and filtering locally for comprehensive results
- Converting categories to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
- Using `categories.any((cat) => cat.contains(lowerQuery))` for category matching

### Frontend Enhancements

1. **Search Tab Updates** (`search_tab.dart`):

   - Added `_selectedCategory` state variable
   - Added `_popularCategories` list with common book categories
   - Implemented `_buildCategoryFilter()` method for category UI
   - Added `_onCategorySelected()` method for category selection logic
   - Updated search logic to handle category selection

2. **Customer Dashboard Updates** (`customer_dashboard.dart`):
   - Updated search placeholder text to include "categories"

## Data Structure Support

The implementation leverages the existing Firestore document structure:

```json
{
  "category": ["Science", "Non-Fiction", "Biography"],
  "title": "Brain on Fire",
  "author": "Susannah Cahalan",
  "description": "..."
  // other fields
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Search by Category Name

1. Type "Science" in the search bar → Returns all books with "Science" in their category array
2. Type "fiction" (case-insensitive) → Returns all Fiction books

### Browse by Category

1. Tap on "Science" filter chip → Shows all Science books
2. Tap on "Biography" filter chip → Shows all Biography books
3. Tap selected chip again → Clears filter and shows empty state

### Mixed Search

1. Type "Brain" → Returns books matching title, author, or description
2. Select "Science" category → Filters to Science books only
3. Type new search → Automatically clears category filter

## Benefits

- **Improved Discoverability**: Users can easily browse books by genre/topic
- **Better UX**: Visual category chips are more intuitive than typing
- **Flexible Search**: Supports both text and visual search methods
- **Performance**: Leverages existing efficient search implementation
- **Accessibility**: Maintains keyboard navigation and screen reader support
