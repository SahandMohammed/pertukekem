# Pertukekem Push Notification System Implementation

## Overview

A complete system-wide push notification system has been implemented for the Pertukekem app, enabling store owners to receive real-time notifications when customers place orders, even when the app is closed.

## Components Implemented

### 1. FCM Service (`lib/core/services/fcm_service.dart`)

- **Purpose**: Handles Firebase Cloud Messaging integration
- **Features**:
  - FCM token management and storage in Firestore
  - Notification permission requests
  - Message handlers for foreground, background, and terminated app states
  - In-app notification display system
  - Topic subscription for store-specific notifications
  - Navigation handling for different notification types
  - Token cleanup on user signout

### 2. Enhanced Notification Service (`lib/features/dashboards/store/services/notification_service.dart`)

- **Purpose**: Creates in-app notifications and triggers push notifications
- **Features**:
  - New order notification creation
  - Order status update notifications
  - Order cancellation notifications
  - Push notification trigger document creation for Cloud Functions
  - Integration with FCM service

### 3. Updated Notification Model (`lib/features/dashboards/store/models/notification_model.dart`)

- **Changes**: Added `storeId` field to support store-specific notifications
- **Purpose**: Ensures notifications are properly associated with specific stores

### 4. Enhanced Order Service (`lib/features/orders/service/order_service.dart`)

- **Integration**: Added notification creation when orders are placed or updated
- **Features**:
  - Automatic notification creation on new orders
  - Notification creation on order status updates
  - Customer information retrieval for personalized notifications

### 5. Firebase Cloud Functions (`functions/src/index.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Server-side push notification handling
- **Functions**:
  - `sendPushNotification`: Processes push notification triggers
  - `onOrderStatusUpdate`: Handles order status change notifications
  - `onNewStoreCreation`: Sends welcome notifications to new store owners
- **Features**:
  - FCM token management and cleanup
  - Multi-device support
  - Automatic invalid token removal

### 6. Android Configuration

- **Manifest Updates**: Added FCM permissions and service configurations
- **Permissions**: Internet, boot completed, vibrate
- **Services**: FCM background message handling

### 7. App Initialization (`lib/main.dart`)

- **Integration**: FCM service initialization on app startup
- **Background Handler**: Top-level background message handler

### 8. Test Screen (`lib/core/test/notification_test_screen.dart`)

- **Purpose**: Testing and debugging notifications
- **Features**:
  - Test new order notifications
  - Test order update notifications
  - Test direct push notifications
  - Check user FCM data

## How It Works

### Order Notification Flow

1. **Customer Places Order** → Order Service creates order in Firestore
2. **Order Service** → Creates notification document and push notification trigger
3. **Cloud Function** → Detects trigger, retrieves store owner's FCM tokens
4. **FCM** → Sends push notification to store owner's devices
5. **App** → Handles notification based on app state (foreground/background/terminated)

### Notification Types

- **New Order**: When a customer places an order
- **Order Update**: When order status changes (confirmed, shipped, delivered, etc.)
- **Order Cancellation**: When an order is cancelled
- **Welcome**: When a new store is created

### Multi-Device Support

- FCM tokens are stored per device in user documents
- Notifications are sent to all registered devices
- Invalid tokens are automatically cleaned up

## Dependencies Added

- `firebase_messaging: ^15.1.7` - FCM Flutter plugin

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /c/Projects/pertukekem---Copy
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Deploy Cloud Functions

```bash
cd /c/Projects/pertukekem---Copy/functions
npm install
npm run deploy
```

### 3. Test Implementation

1. Run the app on a physical device (FCM doesn't work on emulators)
2. Navigate to the notification test screen
3. Use the test buttons to verify notification functionality
4. Place test orders to verify the complete flow

## Key Features

### ✅ Implemented

- FCM token management
- Push notification delivery
- In-app notification display
- Background message handling
- Order notification integration
- Multi-device support
- Invalid token cleanup
- Cloud Functions for server-side processing

### 🔄 Ready for Testing

- Complete order-to-notification flow
- Store owner notification reception
- App state handling (foreground/background/terminated)
- Notification navigation and actions

### 📱 Platform Support

- Android: ✅ Fully configured
- iOS: ⚠️ Requires additional iOS-specific configuration

## Security Considerations

- FCM tokens are securely stored in Firestore
- Cloud Functions use Firebase Admin SDK for secure server-side operations
- User authentication is verified before sending notifications
- Store ownership is validated before notification creation

## Monitoring and Debugging

- Console logging in FCM service for debugging
- Cloud Function logs for server-side monitoring
- Test screen for manual verification
- Firestore documents for notification tracking

## Next Steps for Production

1. **iOS Configuration**: Add iOS-specific FCM setup
2. **Notification Customization**: Add custom sounds, icons, and actions
3. **Analytics**: Implement notification delivery tracking
4. **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize notification settings
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for notification sending

The implementation provides a robust foundation for push notifications with proper error handling, multi-device support, and scalable cloud function architecture.
